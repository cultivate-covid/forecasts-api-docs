# Prediction Sets / Forecasts

A prediction set is the primary model for storing individual user forecasts within Cultivate Forecasts. A prediction set can contain a single prediction or multiple predictions, depending on the question type. In a prediction market, all prediction sets have a single prediction (a trade). In an opinion pool, prediction sets have one prediction for each answer in the question.
